Here I will host my personal free software projects.

Licensing is defined in a per-project basis. In general I use GPLv3 or later, but different licensing may be used for some projects, or for some third party modules, and will be stated explicitly in the directories. If you are unsure about licencing of some of my code, this means I may have forgotten to state it explicitly. Please contact me for any licensing questions/issues.
