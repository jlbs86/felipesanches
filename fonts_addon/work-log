* Code's been published in my personal svn repo at Google Code. I like the idea of using Gitorious, but I am not confortable with git yet. I'll probably reconsider it in the future. Right now, code is here: http://code.google.com/p/felipesanches/source/list
 
* updated the warning message to say:

This will copy " + whatfont + " to your fonts directory.
Please inspect the font to ensure it is free software or you are otherwise legally permitted to use this font on your computer. If it is not free software you may not be permitted to do so without paying for a license.

* studied a bit of XUL
* started to work on a "Configure..." dialog and a "Font Preview" window.

I'm planning on a tabbed window with these tabs: "Font Metadata", "Lore Ipsum", "Live Preview".
